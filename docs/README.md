# Wiliot

Welcome to the Wiliot Developer Community! Wiliot is an Ambient IoT SaaS company that connects the digital and physical worlds using its revolutionary IoT Pixel tagging technology. These IoT Pixels are computers the size of a postage stamp that power themselves in unique ways. ​

Wiliot’s vision is to expand IoT to be an Ambient Internet of Trillions of things. By adding intelligence to everyday products, such as plastic crates, pharmaceuticals, packaging, clothes, and other items, these products can be connected to the Internet, revolutionizing the way things are made, distributed, sold, used, reused, and recycled. ​

The Wiliot Platform enables visibility and insights from product manufacturing to end-of-life, creating an ecosystem that spans from factories, through the supply chain, to the retailer, and even into the user’s home. By using IoT Pixels and the Wiliot Cloud, temperature and usage can be sensed while securely managing unique digital IDs. Additionally, the hyper-thin, embeddable form factor does not impinge on the look or use of products but instead adds functionality, without the need for tapping or scanning. ​

This revolutionary combination of cloud and semiconductor technology is being used by some of the world’s largest brands, food, and pharmaceutical companies, changing how we make, distribute, sell, use, and recycle products. Join our community to learn more about the Wiliot Platform and how it is transforming the Internet of Things!

## What are Wiliot IoT Pixels?

Wiliot’s IoT Pixels empower every product, every object, every ‘thing’, to sense and to fix inefficiencies and problems it encounters.

Battery-Free IoT Pixels are computers the size of a postage stamp that power themselves by harvesting radio waves.
This Pixel has essentially no limits to life, is embeddable, and operates with minimal low-cost infrastructure for harvesting and reading. Being battery-free combined with innovative tag production techniques gives the IoT Pixel advantages in size, cost and maintenance.
